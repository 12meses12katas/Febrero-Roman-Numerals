RomanNumerals in JS by Enrique Amodeo Rubio
=========

I've forced myself to code this kata following some restrictions:

* Reasonably performance. At least O(n)
* Do not use 'IV', 'IX', 'XL', 'CD', etc. as basic roman numerals.
* Use JavaScript compatible with IE6. Those fancy iterators are not allowed.
* Do not use RegExp.
* Object oriented style, not procedural.
* The table of roman numerals to arabic numbers must be parametrizable
